# conio - Controlled I/O

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rusq/conio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rusq/conio)

Package conio provides controlled I/O reader and writer.  It may be useful when
you need to have a compressed reader/writer over the net.Conn and then resume
your normal reads and writes on it.
